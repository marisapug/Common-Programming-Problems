This repository includes my solutions to some common programming problems and puzzles. I have organized it by programming language. I will try to post solutions to the same problem in multiple languages!

More problems and solutions will be added periodically. I did my best to include time complexity where relevant as well as compare and contrast different approaches.

Instructions on how to run in the command line:

Python:
python filename.py

Java:
Compile: javac ClassName.java
Run: java ClassName


C:
Compile (gcc compiler): gcc -o filename filename.c
Run: ./filename
